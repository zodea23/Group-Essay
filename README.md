# A History of the Kogi(Kogui) People
## 0
The Kogi tribe is one of the few tribes that are in Colombia. They are the descendants of an ancient civilization called the Tayrona. In the 15th century, because of Spanish conquistadores, they moved higher up into the mountains to stay in isolation for centuries. Although, they have lost most of their middle to lower ancestral land because of colonization. The population size of the Kogi people is about 20,000 people and their main language is Kogi. In their language, “Kogi” means ‘jaguar’. Their belief is in the “Mother” which is what they call their goddess or creator.

Notable points in the Kogi’s history in relation to land start with Spain. The Spanish were the first dominant sovereignty the Kogi encountered, this drove the Kogi up the mountains to live in isolation but they lost ownership of their valley. In the 1960’s the Kogi’s land was taken over by the drug trade and the violence it brought with it.  In 2009 the Kogi reoccupied the Santa Clara river basin and built their first intercultural school.

From the 1970’s the Kogi have secured legal recognition for 650,000 hectares of ancestral land in three indiginous reserves. However this is not always the case, circa 2014 a group of businessmen and politicians planned to build a sea port in a sacred site. The Kogi filed a consultation to argue construction would affect the ecological health of the valley as well as being a sacred site for the Kogi. The Kogi did a lot of research on the impact this port will have on the local environment of the Sierra Nevada however the court concluded that the construction would not harm the indiginous people of the Sierra Nevada therefore construction continues. This due to the Kogi being unable to present their environmental argument in front of court. Furthermore the Kogi were pressured into signing an agreement for compensation but this agreement contradicts Kogi law.  However in 2016 the Colombian president signed a peace agreement to help preserve Kogi lands and help the environment; 150 hectares have been protected in the Caribbean coast. On the other hand rapid construction development is still occuring, this fact questions the effectiveness of the peace agreement and how closely it is being followed.

The above events could give reason that Colombia has violated the Kogi’s human right to land ownership, Article 19 in the UDHR. This is because the government does not recognise their association to the land and grant them ownership and control of it. They also didn’t receive a fair trial during their consultation of the seaport. Their reports on the Sierra Nevada’s ecosystem were not presented in court which left the businessmen with the ability to continue construction even with the court in a state of indecision.

Their values toward the Earth are very nature related. They believe in spirituality and cosmology. They use meditation, ritual offerings, songs, and prayers to connect to the sacred sites. The mountain range where they live, they see as a living entity that was created by Sezhankwa. Sezhankwa created all the people who live there in their tribe and before the land was created, it existed in the spiritual world. They hold the belief that they are the guardians of the heart of the Earth and that it is their job to protect the earth from the ‘younger brothers’. They classify ‘younger brothers’ as non-indigenous people. They live to care for the world.

The environmental challenges that the tribe face also mirror a lot of what the whole world is facing. Although, the Kogi tribe has tried to make positive changes. Such as, they came out of isolation in 1990, to warn others about how the earth and environment are being destroyed. They expressed how Sierra Nevada is mirroring the rest of the world. They said that they witnessed landslides, floods, deforestation, drying up of rivers, and lakes, bare tops of mountains and the dying of trees. They said these are terrible signs and everyone must change their ways before it is too late. Although, unfortunately, many people did not listen or heed to the words of the tribe.

The UN has funded the OGT (Gonawindu Tayrona Organisation) to help the Kogi upkeep a successful coffee trade. Coffee is a central part of Kogi culture, both spiritually and economically. This support from the UN allows the Kogi to keep sovereignty of their trade and business, this prevents middlemen taking advantage of their artistry and business.
